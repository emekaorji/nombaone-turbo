 * ambiguous catalog state — nothing downstream can say which one the pricing page
 * should show. Inside a single array the check is free (pure, no DB round-trip),
 * so we close it at the boundary.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: this does NOT close the hole globally. `POST /v1/plans/:id/prices`
 * can still add a second active monthly price to the same plan a minute later; only
 * a partial unique index on `(plan_id, interval, interval_count) WHERE active` can
 * do that, and that is a FOLLOW-UP migration, not this change.
 *
 * Runs AFTER the element parse, so `intervalCount` carries its default — i.e.
 * `{ interval: 'month' }` and `{ interval: 'month', intervalCount: 1 }` collide,
